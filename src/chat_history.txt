User: who was gandhi
Response: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, often known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist. He was born on 2nd October 1869 and died on 30th January 1948. Gandhi employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. His actions inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title "Mahatma" in July 1914. Isn't it fascinating how one person can make such a big difference, Irlwi? ðŸ˜Š
